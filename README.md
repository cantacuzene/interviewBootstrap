# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### What to do

Code a basic todo App.
Use your best practises to implement :

-   A submit form
-   A list of remaining tasks
-   A list of done tasks

A Task consists of a string and any other property that you deem fit.
You should be able to check/uncheck a task, thus chainging its completion status.

Styling and task deletion are optional (I.e. you might not have time to do it).


### What is available to you:

-   the latest react package CRA offers
-   the latests @mui/material
-   the uuid package

You can also check https://beta.reactjs.org/ , https://mui.com/  and https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid for documentation purposes
